# Pintos
Labs for OS class (cs372) at Denison University. [Pintos](http://pintos-os.org)
is a teaching operating system for x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small
but realistic enough to understand OS in depth (it can run x86 machine and simulators
including QEMU, Bochs and VMWare Player!). The main source code, documentation and assignments
are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).
